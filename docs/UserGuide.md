## 1. Introduction
(Contributed by Tan Yu Li, James)

Welcome to the User Guide of **HairStyleX**.
 
Today, many budding hair salons still resort to using pen and paper to keep track of their appointments, clients, and hairdressers due to their tight budget. While suitable for a small client base, this is not sustainable in the long run as their client base increases, since recording and searching for information manually would be slow and prone to human errors. Our salon management application **HairStyleX** is designed to make this process much easier for salon managers who have at least a laptop at their front desk.

This application uses a Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you operate the application by typing commands into a Command Box. If you are fast at typing, you can manage your appointments faster than other Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications; GUI applications allow users to interact with the application through graphical icons such as buttons.

The purpose of this user guide is to provide you with an in-depth documentation on how to install and use our application. What are you waiting for? Head on to [Section 2, “Quick Start”](#2-quick-start) .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Quick Start

To get started with using **HairStyleX**, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `HairStyleX.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for **HairStyleX**.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the one shown below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

1. At the top of the screen, type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

1. Refer to [Section 3.2.3, "Command Syntax and Usage"](#323-command-syntax-and-usage) on how to use commands and [Section 4, "Features"](#4-features) below for details of each command.

#### 4.3.6 Filtering hairdressers : `filter_hairdresser`

You can filter the list of hairdressers in the database with a keyword search that matches their names.

**Format:**

 `filter_hairdresser KEYWORD...`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `anna`, `aNNa` will match `Anna`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Anna Yeoh` will match `Yeoh Anna`.
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Ann` will not match `Anna`.
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Anna Yeoh` will return `Anna Cheung`, `David Yeoh`.

</div>

**Example:**

You wish to find the hairdresser **Bella** from the database and check her full name and specialisations. You will perform the following steps:

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-white">

### 4.4 Appointment Management

(contributed by Nicholas Toh)

This feature allows you to manage appointments between hairdressers and clients. You can record the following information about appointments: 
* Client
* Hairdresser
* Date
* Time
* Status

#### 4.4.1 Appointment Management Command Parameters

Parameter Name | Description
--------|------------------
`CLIENT_ID` | The ID of the client `cid`
`HAIRDRESSER_ID` | The ID of the hairdresser `hid`
`DATE` | The date of the appointment.<br><br> It must be in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD`, following the ISO8601 standard.<br><br> E.g. `2020-12-13` This example means 13th December 2020.
`TIME` | The time of the appointment.<br><br> It must be in the format of `HH:MM`.<br><br> E.g. `17:30` This example means 5.30 pm.
`STATUS` | The status of the appointment, which can be `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED`, or `MISSED`
`ID` | The appointment ID `aid` that represents the appointment.

#### 4.4.2 Adding an appointment : `add_appt`

You can use this command to add an appointment to the database.

**Format**: `add_appt cid/CLIENT_ID hid/HAIRDRESSER_ID d/DATE t/TIME`
* `CLIENT_ID` must be a valid client ID (cid)
* `HAIRDRESSER_ID` must be a valid hairdresser ID (hid)
* `DATE` must be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format
* `TIME` must be entered in 24 Hour HH:MM format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">  

**:information_source: Notes about creating appointments**  

* All appointments are active by default.  

* All appointments have a duration of **2 hours**. Hence the end time of an appointment is implicitly two hours after the start time. This is because two hours is a reasonable time period required for any hair treatment. If an appointment is completed earlier, the hairdresser can take charge of walk in customers. 

* Appointments involving the same persons (hairdresser or client) should not overlap in time. Equivalently, no person should be simultaneously involved in two appointments.  

* Appointments should only be created in the future.  

* Appointment IDs may not be in order.
</div>

**Example**:
In the example below, you will create an appointment between **client 1** and **hairdresser 2** on **12th December 2020** at **5.30pm**. (This assumes that the client and hairdresser currently exist.) You will perform the following steps:

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-white">

Adding a new appointment: <br>

1. Type `add_appt cid/1 hid/2 d/2020-12-12 t/17:30` into the *Command Box*.
1. Press `Enter` to execute.

Outcome: <br>

1. You can now see information about the added appointment in the *Appointments Panel*.  
    * If you had previously filtered appointments (refer to [Section 4.4.6](#446-filtering-appointments--filter_appt)), the filter may be removed.

</div>

## 5. FAQ
(Contributed by Tan Yu Li, James)

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous **HairStyleX** home folder.

**Q**: Why aren’t I allowed to edit my date or time for the appointment?<br>
**A**: Editing the date or time may cause conflicts in your schedule if the change results in two appointments with the same hairdresser occuring concurrently. However, we are working on a feature that will allow you to resolve these conflicts in the upcoming version of **HairStyleX**.

**Q**: What do I do if I want to change my appointment’s date or time since I cannot edit them?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, you have to delete the appointment and create a new one.

**Q**: What happens if I schedule 2 of my appointments with the same hairdresser on the same date and time? Will **HairStyleX** detect it?<br>
**A**: Yes, **HairStyleX** will detect such cases and prevent you from creating such an appointment.
