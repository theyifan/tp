## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_client 1`.

![Sequence Diagram of the Logic Component](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800">

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `HairStyleXParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete_client 1")` API call.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="800">

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteClientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the **HairStyleX** data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>`, `ObservableList<Hairdresser>`, `ObservableList<Appointment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the HairStyleX data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Command Shortcut feature
This feature allows users to define their own shortcuts for commands that make it easier for them to type.
#### Current Implementation
![Structure of the Shortcut Command Feature](images/CommandShortcutClassDiagram.png)

This shows the general structure used to implement the Command Alias.
* `Command Word` - This is an enumeration that corresponds to each command in the application.
* `CommandShortcut` - This is a class which stores the hashset of strings that correspond to a particular word. These strings 
are the command word's shortcuts.
* `CommandShortcutSet` - This is a singleton class which stores all the commandShortcut in the application.
It is responsible for finding the command word associated with a given input string and to validate whether the 
new shortcuts are allowed to be saved into the system.

#### Add Shortcuts
Steps: 
1. User input a command to the system. It is parsed regularly as before, extracting the string.
2. `HairStyleXParser` will pass the string to `CommandShortcutSet` to retrieve the corresponding `CommandWord`.
3. Then, the `CommandWord` is processed as usual.

Steps when adding a new shortcut:
1. User inputs an `add_shortcut` command together with the new shortcut, and the command it is associated with.
2. Upon execution, `CommndShortcutSet` will do validation to check if the validity of the new shortcut. 
3. Finally, `CommandShortcutSet` adds the new shortcut to the `CommandShortcut` it is matched to.

Steps when deleting a new shortcut
1. User inputs an `delete_shortcut` command together with the shortcut to be deleted.
2. Upon execution, `CommndShortcutSet` will check if the shortcut to be deleted exists and find its corresponding `CommandShortcut`. 
3. Finally, `CommandShortcutSet` deletes the shortcut from the `CommandShortcut`.

Steps when listing all shortcuts
1. User inputs an `list_shortcut` command.
2. Upon execution, `CommndShortcutSet` will retrieve the string representation of all its `CommandShortcut` and combine them into one string.
3. Finally, `CommandShortcutSet` returns the string representation of all its shortcuts.

#### Saving the Shortcut

`JsonHairStyleXStorage` saves `CommandShortcutSet` as a `JsonAdapatedCommandShortcutSet` together with its `JsonAdaptedShortcut`.
Upon starting the application,  `JsonHairStyleXStorage` is used to set the singleton `CommandShortcutSet`.

### Hairdresser Management Features

#### Overview of implementation for Hairdresser

* `Hairdresser` - This is an entity class to store information regarding an appointment, such as name, phone, email, gender, title, specialisation.
* `Specialisation` - This is class containing an enum which represents the specialisations of a hairdresser, which includes `Color`, `Perm`, `HairExtension`, `Styling`, `HairConditioning`, `Straightening`, `ScalpTreatment`, `HairLossTreatment`.
* `HairdresserID` - This is a class which represents the unique ID of an appointment.
* `UniqueHairdresserList` - This is a `UniqueEntityList` which represents all hairdressers. It ensures that no duplicates of hairdresser can be added and supports add, update, delete of hairdressers.
* `JsonAdaptedHairdresser` - This class functions as an adapter between Appointment and the Storage layer. It specifies how to convert from an appointment object to a JSON representation and vice versa. It also serves as validation for correct data format when the save file is loaded.
* `AddHairdresserCommandParser` - This class parses a user input string to a `HairdresserCommand` object and performs validation.
* `AddHairdresserCommand` - This contains `execute` method which interact with model to perform the add action.

#### Add Hairdresser Feature

##### Current implementation

The `add_hairdresser` command allows the `LogicManager` to create a new hairdresser and add it to the list of hairdressers. 

The following sequence shows the sequence when the add command is execute by the `LogicManager`:

![AddHairdresserSequenceDiagram](images/AddHairdresserSequenceDiagram.png)

From the diagram above:

1. `LogicManager`’s `execute` is called when the user enters a command string into the command box. The string is passed to `execute` as an argument, and it calls `parseCommand` of `HairStyleXParser` to parse the command string.

2. `HairStyleXParser` will initialize `AddHairdresserCommandParser` and invoke the method `parse` to further parse the command

3. `parse` of `AddHairdresserCommandParser` will be invoked and passed the parameters of the add hairdresser command. 

4. If all the arguments of `add_hairdresser` commands are valid, `AddHairdresserCommand` will be returned to the `LogicManager`

5. `LogicManger` will then call `execute` method of `AddHairdresserCommand`

6. `AddHairdresserCommand` will call `addHairdresser` passing `toAdd` as an argument to `Model` and returns a `result` to the `LogicManager`

7. `LogicManger` will then call `saveHairStyleX` method of `Storage`

8. A `CommandResult` will be returned at the end.


### Appointment feature

This feature represents an appointment between a hairdresser and a client. An appointment consists of a client and a hairdresser. If one of these persons are deleted, the reference will be replaced with a tombstone value indicating a deleted hairdresser/client. A client can have multiple appointments that do not clash, similarly for hairdressers. An appointment must also have a date, time, and status.

#### Overview of implementation for Appointment

* `Appointment` - This is an entity class to store information regarding an appointment, such as hairdresser, client, hairdresser ID, client ID, date, time and status.
                       
* `FutureAppointment` - This is an entity class which extends Appointment. This class ensures that a newly created appointment is always in the future compared to the system time.

* `AppointmentStatus` - This is an enum which represents the status of an appointment, which can be `active`, `completed`, or `missed`.

* `AppointmentID` - This is a class which represents the unique ID of an appointment.

* `UniqueAppointmentList` - This is a `UniqueEntityList` which represents all appointments. It implements features including ensuring that no duplicate appointments can be added. It allows for clients or hairdressers to be replaced or deleted, and updates the relevant appointments.

* `JsonAdaptedAppointment` - This class functions as an adapter between Appointment and the Storage layer. It specifies how to convert from an appointment object to a JSON representation and vice versa. It also serves as validation for correct data format when the save file is loaded.

* `AddAppointmentCommandParser` - This class parses a user input string to an AppointmentCommand object. Validation for inputs that do not require access to the model is performed here.

* `AddAppointmentCommand` - This is where majority of the logic of the add appointment command is performed when the `execute` method is called. It will access the model to ensure there is no duplicate appointment before adding the appointment to the model.

#### Add Appointment Feature
##### Current implementation

![AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

From the diagram above:

1. When the user enters a command string into the command box,`LogicManager`’s `execute` is called when with the string as an argument. This command string is logged, and then passed to `parseCommand` of `HairStyleXParser` which parses the command.

2. If the command string matches the format for an add appointment command, `HairStyleXParser` will initialize an `AddAppointmentCommandParser` and invoke the method `parse` to further parse the command.

3. `parse` of `AddAppointmentCommandParser` will be invoked, and passed the parameters of the add hairdresser command. Here, validation that does not require access to the model is performed, for example, validating the format of hairdresser ID, client ID, date, and time. It ensures that the date/time is valid and is in the future, but does not check whether the hairdresser/client ID corresponds to an actual hairdresser/client (this is validated when the command is executed). 

4. If the command is valid, a new `AddAppointmentCommand` object is created and returned to the `LogicManager`. Otherwise, a `ParseException` may be thrown.

5. `LogicManger` will then call the `execute` method of `AddAppointmentCommand`, with the `model` as an argument. Here, checks are performed, such as verifying if the hairdresser/client ID corresponds to an actual hairdresser/client, and the appointment is checked against existing appointments in the model to ensure that there are no duplicates or clashes. The appointment object is then added to the model.

6. If the command is valid, `AddAppointmentCommand` will call `addAppointment` of `Model` with the newly created appointment as an argument, then it will return a `CommandResult`. Otherwise, a `CommandException` may be thrown.

7. `LogicManger` will then call `saveHairStyleX` method of `Storage`. This triggers storing information to non-volatile memory using the Storage layer.

8. The `CommandResult` is returned.

#### Proposed improvements
1. Currently, validation or updating of appointments based on client/hairdresser ID requires iterating through all appointments to check if they involve the relevant client/hairdresser. Hence this process is slow and runs in O(n) time. It can be improved by implementing two `HashMaps` of appointments keyed by `ClientId`/`HairdresserId`  respectively. This will allow for the search to be done in O(1) time. We did not implement this feature as it would introduce unnecessary complexity, and the current solution meets the non-functional requirements regarding performance.

1. Currently, the order of appointments in the `UniqueAppointmentList` is not ordered by time. Hence, sorting appointments by appointment time requires O(n log(n)) time. By maintaining a `TreeMap` of appointments keyed by time, a list of appointments ordered by appointment time can be generated in O(n), while the next k appointments after a given appointment can be found in O(k log(n)) time. We did not implement this feature as it would introduce unnecessary complexity, and the current solution meets the non-functional requirements regarding performance.

### ID and ID Counter

To ensure that every entity within the same class can be distinguished from each other, we have implemented an auto incremental ID system that automatically assigns to a new ID to every entity upon creation.

#### Reasons for Implementation

Initially, we intended to follow the original AddressBook-3, where each `Person` would be identified by its shown index in the list shown in the GUI. However, we came to the realisation this approach would confuse the user during this scenario:

* When the user searches for an entity with filters, the filtered list would show indices that are not corresponding to the original list. As such, the user might erroneously key in the wrong index for his/her selected entity.

To tackle this, we concluded that each entity should be identified by a unique ID within its own class, and that this should be displayed to the user and be the primary way of identifying entities for the purposes of editing, deleting, etc.

#### Current Implementation

##### ID Class

* The Model package contains an abstract `Id` class, which is essentially a wrapper for an integer `id` variable.
* The `Id` class also has a concrete method used to verify the validity of the `id`.
* The concrete classes `AppointmentId`, `ClientId`, and `HairdresserId` extend the abstract Id class, and reside in their respective packages.
* These concrete classes contain their unique error messages which will be shown when an instance is created with an invalid id.

<img src="images/IDClassDiagram.png" width="200" />

##### ID Counter Class

* To ensure that the IDs of each entity created are unique, a final class `IdCounter` is implemented. 
* This class is a singleton, and only one instance can exist at any one time.
* It consists of static integer attributes that keep track of the next ID to be generated for the respective entities, namely, Clients, Hairdressers, and Appointments.
* `IdCounter` has methods to generate the next unique `ClientId`, `HairdresserId` and `AppointmentId`.
* In order to avoid collisions, whenever a `ClientId` is generated, the next `ClientId` generated will be increased by 1.
    * Likewise for `HairdresserId` and `AppointmentId`

<img src="images/IDCounterClassDiagram.png" width="200" />

#### Design Considerations

* Alternative 1 (current implementation): Use 3 separate counters in `IdCounter` for `Client`s, `Hairdresser`s, `Appointment`s
  * Pros: Good OOP Design. Error messages can be abstracted out in their respective ID classes
  * Cons: Hassle to keep track of three separate counters, and repetitive to have three separate methods for these counters

* Alternative 2: Use 1 single counter for all entities. Every entity contains an ID instance.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, no repetitive code.
  * Cons: Bad OOP design. Error messages would be the same for IDs created in all three classes
  
#### Usage Scenario

Given below is the example usage scenario that highlights the generation of a new `ClientId` instance when a new `Client` is created:

![IDSequenceDiagram](images/IDSequenceDiagram.png)

From the diagram above:

1. The user attempts to create a new client by entering the respective fields in the appropriate format, such as `add_client n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com g/M a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25`

1. The `AddClientCommandParser` extracts the relevant fields from the user input and creates a new `Client` instance using the `Client` constructor.

1. The `Client` constructor calls `IdCounter` to generate a new `ClientId` instance.

1. The returned `ClientId` is stored in this client object, which will be used to create AddClientCommand.

### Filter Feature

Since now all entities are categorized into different classes, we want to make sure each class can have their own filter method to easily find an entity or a list of entities within a class.

#### Reasons for implementation

The filter hairdresser/client feature can be useful when a specific client/hairdresser's information is needed at the moment. The filter appointment feature can be useful when scheduling a new appointment. By allowing the manager to check the availability of a certain hairdresser,
or filter out a list of all appointments in a certain day, it avoids creating conflicting appointments and provides a more efficient way of scheduling appointments.

#### Use cases

1. a hairdresser or a list of hairdressers can be filtered by their name

2. a client or a list of clients can be filtered by their name

2. an appointment or a list of appointments can be filtered by hairdresser's id, client's id, date of appointment, status of appointment or a combination of any of them.

#### Usage Scenario

Given below is the example usage scenario of filtering a client:

The `filter_client Anna` command allows the `LogicManager` to create one or a list of clients whose name contains "Anna". 

The following sequence shows the sequence when the filter command is execute by the `LogicManager`:

![FilterClientCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FilterClientCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

From the diagram above:

1. `LogicManager`’s `execute` is called when `filter_client Anna` is entered and it calls upon `parseCommand` of `HairStyleXParser` to parse the command.

2. `HairStyleXParser` will initialize `FilterClientCommandParser` and invoke the method `parse` to further parse filter client command

3. `parse` will be invoked and passed the parameters of the filter client command.

4. If all the arguments of the filter command are valid, `FilterClientCommand` will be returned to the `LogicManager`

5. `LogicManger` will then call `execute` method of `FilterClientCommand`

6. `FilterClientCommand` will call `updateFilteredClientList` passing `predicate` as an argument to `Model` and returns a `result` to the `LogicManager`

7. `LogicManger` will then call `saveHairStyleX` method of `Storage`

8. A `CommandResult` will be returned at the end.

### Print Feature

`Print` feature is to allow users to export data to an easy-to-read format. It allows the lists of hairdressers, clients and appointments to be exported to `.csv` format.

#### Current Implementation

`PrintCommand` - This contains `execute` method which interact with model to perform the export action.

Some key methods:

- `ExportType` - a private enum that encapsulates the type of information to be exported. Contains `ExportType.Hairdresser`, `ExportType.Client`, `ExportType.Appointment`.
- `PrintCommand#writeToCsv()` - initialises a `.csv` file for hairdresser, client or appointment depending on the `ExportType` enum given and then writes to it.
- `PrintCommand#appendToWriter()` - calls the respective functions that convert data to string and appends the returned string to the `.csv` files.
- `PrintCommand#removeCommaConflict()` - escapes the strings containing commas to avoid formatting error when writing to `.csv` files.

#### Steps

1. `LogicManager`’s `execute` is called when `print` is entered and it calls upon `parseCommand` of `HairStyleXParser` to parse the command.

1. `PrintCommand` will be returned to the `LogicManager` and `LogicManger` will then call `execute` method of `PrintCommand`.

1. `execute` method retrieves the three `ObservableList`: `hairdresserList`, `clientList`, `appointmentList` from the model.

1. `execute` method will then call `writeToCsv` 3 times in parallel while passing in `ExportType.Hairdresser`, `ExportType.Client`, `ExportType.Appointment` for each.

1. `writeToCsv` will create `BufferedWriter` for the respective `.csv` files in `[root directory of HairStyleX]/data/[ExportType].csv` according to `ExportType`, then pass the writer and `ExportType` to `appendToWriter`.

1. `appendToWriter` calls the respective functions that converts data to string according to `ExportType`:

    - For `ExportType.Hairdresser`: `makeFileCreationTime`, `makeHairdresserHeader` are called, and `printHairdresser` is called for each in `hairdresserList`.
    - For `ExportType.Client`: `makeFileCreationTime`, `makeClientHeader` are called, and `printClient` is called for each in `clientList`.
    - For `ExportType.Appointment`: `makeFileCreationTime`, `makeAppointmentHeader` are called, and `printAppointment` is called for each in `appointmentList`.

    Each of the methods called by `appendToWriter` returns a string that makes up of one line of the `.csv` file, and is appended to the file line by line. After the writing operations are done, the writer is closed.

1. A `CommandResult` will be returned at the end.

#### Activity Diagram
![PrintActivityDiagram](images/PrintActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

* Alternative 1 (current implementation): Run `writeToCsv` concurrently
  * Pros: Shorter overall runtime as the functions are run in parallel.
  * Cons: More overhead for the program as there are multi-threads created.

* Alternative 2: Run `writeToCsv` sequentially
  * Pros: Easy to implement, less overhead.
  * Cons: Longer runtime as the I/O operations are ran one by one even if it is I/O to different files.

## **Appendix: Effort**

Creating HairStyleX required much effort from all the team members. Due to COVID-19, we did not meet up, and had to work around the limitations of virtual collaboration. We persevered, and honed our communication and teamwork skills through this project. Our members made sacrifices to their schedules in order to attend our weekly online meetings. By the end, we achieved excellent communication as a team. Our final product contained around 20KLoC. This showcases our hard work and dedication in creating HairStyleX.

### Major Enhancements
HairStyleX has many significant enhancements from AB3. Here are some examples:

* The Person class was extended into Hairdresser and Client classes, each with their own attributes and validations.

* The Appointment feature was created to represent an association between a Hairdresser and Client. It includes complex features such as scheduling, status, and conflict detection.

* Shortcuts were implemented such that users can define their own shortcuts for each command. This feature also supports multiple shortcuts for the same command.

* Filtering functionality for Hairdresser, Client, and Appointment makes use of the app more practical even with a large data set.

### Challenges and considerations
Throughout the development of HairStyleX, we faced many challenges. The following points will describe these challenges what how did we deal with them.

#### Large number of classes/entities
There was a large increase in the number of entities to implement and manage. We also had to be careful of unwanted interactions between them causing bugs.

While AB3 deals with only one (Person) model object, HairStyleX deals with multiple (Client, Hairdresser, Appointment, Filtered List, Shortcut). Thus, we had to create much functionality from scratch. In order to avoid unwanted interactions, we followed design patterns and used extensive testing, in addition to communicating well to make sure all team members are aware of how functionality contributed by other teammates works.

#### Revamped UI
The Ui of AB3 only contains one panel (ListPanel). On the other hand, HairStyleX has 3 panels. This added additional complexity. Beyond just duplicating the panels, each panel also incorporated extended functionality of filtering.

#### Appointment statuses
In our initial prototype, we included the status "cancelled" for appointments. However, after some deliberation we decided to remove it, as this would cause unnecessary implementation complexity (especially due to appointment clash detection), and since a salon could still use the client tag field to mark if a client had regularly cancelled appointments.

### Working Process
Our team placed heavy emphasis on communication. and efficient division of workload. With our dedicated members and good team spirit, we were able to produce a great product.

We made use of github's project boards as task trackers, which allowed efficient division and tracking of work, and also helped each team member visualise the tasks remaining.
